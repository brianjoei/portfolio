					<h1>CloudOn iPad App</h1>
					<div class="spacer300"></div>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
						At CloudOn, a tablet first company, I lead the UX redesign of the iPad app to be more focused on collaboration and content discovery. CloudOn was an iPad app, that allowed users to edit documents such as Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and Excel files from their cloud storage device all on iPad app. This technology existed long before Microsoft had any presence in Apple's app store. As CloudOn evolved to a new document editor, we also needed a new design for the iPad app to reflect the strategy of CloudOn.
					</p>
					<img src="img/cloudon_activity.png" alt="activity in CloudOn" class="img-responsive">
					<p>
						We discovered from analyzing user behavior in the iPad App that a large amount 70 percent of activity is not focused on creating and editing. In the existing iPad app, it was very focused on the ability of editing and creating. 
					</p>
					<h2>Problem</h2>
					<p>
						One of the problems that the current app faced was that to access any file operations such as emailing, copying, deleting, or renaming the file, the user would have tap and hold the file for more than 5 seconds to access the menu.</p>
					<p>
						As the strategy of our business depended on more people sharing files and collaborating on documents, CloudOn wanted to make the operation of sharing files easier to access.
					</p>
					<div class="img">
						<img src="img/cloudon_activity_fileoperations.png" class="img-responsive">
					</div>
					<h2>Goals</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Business:</strong> Easy collaboration abilities with documents would create a network of users. Organizational abilities were also important to insure that users would not feel the need leave CloudOn to organize.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Users:</strong> CloudOn is the go to app for everything they need to do with documents on the cloud
					</p>

					<!-- <div class="col-md-2"></div>
					<div class="col-md-8 csContent bg-success"> -->
					<h2>Research</h2>
					<p>
						To understand the users, we read and sorted 500+ app reviews on iTunes. This helped us understand the users goals and frustrations. This also gave us the ability to create 4 distinct personas that we were able to reference. 
					</p>
					<div class="img">
						<img src="img/cloudon_persona.png" alt="Personas" class="img-responsive">
					</div>
					<p>
						To understand current bottlenecks and frustrations, we consulted the advocacy and user support team on a weekly basis. This helped us understand what problems were urgent from a user facing perspective. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly we synced with the analytics team to understand current user flows, trends and behavior.
					</p>
				
					<h2>Early Design</h2>
					<p>
						To create the designs we started with sketches and paper prototypes. This helped flushed out the design ideas and gave us some ability to validate the concepts internally within the CloudOn team. 
					</p>
					<div class="img">
						<img src="img/cloudon_paperprototype.png" class="img-responsive">
					</div>
					<p>
						In these early prototyping stages, we tried having the file operations appear under the files or in the file space panel. Both of these options would be accessible by tap and holding the file name or by tapping on the "FileSpace Icon"
					</p>
					<h2>FileSpace Panel</h2>
					<p> 
						FileSpace Panel is a new way the users could learn about the context of the file. The main focus of the file space panel is the ability to track, review and comment on documents. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The second priority of the FileSpace Panel, was the ability to share the file with different people or editors and track people who are shared on the file. 
					</p>
					<p> 
						File Options, such as copying, renaming, and deleting, was debated whether it should live in the File Space Panel. File Operations could be a distractions from the focus of collaboration in the FileSpace Panel or it could also serve as an entry point for people to understanding the FileSpace Panel as everything important around the file. 
					</p>
					<h2>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
					<p>
						To further test these two strategies, we created two prototypes in the web app Proto.io. Using Proto.io allowed us to create highly interactive prototypes that can be tested on an iPad. 
					</p>
				
					<img src="img/cloudon_prototype_v1.png" class="img-responsive">
					<p>
						This is an early version that had the file operations in the file space panel. Upon scrolling in the activities list, it would collapse the file operation card and title. 
					</p>
					<img src="img/cloudon_prototype_v2.png" class="img-responsive">
					<p>
						The file operations would slide out beneath the file and file space panel would slide out from the right side as well. This gave for a larger view of the activities and editor panel. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To validate our hypothesis we brought our two prototypes to coffee shops and put it in front of 9 people in exchange for coffee. Participants were tasked to rename the file, share the file, and comment in the activity panel. The successful design would be the one that participants were able to complete the 3 tasks with ease and full understanding. The preference of each design was also noted. 
					</p>
					<p>
						8/10 participants successfully completed the task and preferred the first option with the file options in the FileSpace Panel. 
					</p>
